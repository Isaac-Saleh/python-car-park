<ul>The display must be updated promptly as cars enter or exit.</ul>
<ul>The system should be robust, easy to maintain, and scalable for future enhancements.</ul>
<ul>The application must follow best coding practices and include unit testing.</ul>
<ul>You must use Git and Github for version management. </ul>


<p>It includes a python program for a smart carpark that utilises</p>
